# Real-Time-Face-Compression-Using-PCA-EigenValues-Python-Numpy-OpenCV
-Implemented PCA-based compression and reconstruction of facial images for real-time video calls using eigenfaces.

-Conducted experiments with cross-gender training, limited data (500 images), and domain-specific face sets to evaluate reconstruction quality under occlusions and pose changes.
